Scientific Question: Compared to SARS-CoV, can mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 affect how it interacts with the ACE2 receptor and as a result enables the COVID-19 variant to spread more easily in humans?
You will need the below files in order to run the code:

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The two FASTA files that was used (uploaded here)

Information about where the FASTA files was found: The structures of the S protein receptor binding domain can be obtained from the PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/). In order to find this file, I chose to search for "RDB D614G" on the protein databank (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6GVF). I chose which sequences to use then downloaded the FASTA Sequence file and used this data to import it into Python.
